                The BeeProg2/BeeProg2C programmer is extremely fast and totally
                reliable universal programmer , basically designed as powerfull
                engineering programmer.

                BeeProg3 is ultra speed universal 64-pindrive programmer, where
                design was focused on high-capacity memories programming.

              <li>
                By operating multiple BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C programmers
                simultaneously you can use them in high volume production
                environment - other words, using more
                BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C programmers you can get a universal,
                up to 4 programming sites multiprogrammer, connected to PC by
                USB port. It is important to mention, there is a concurrent
                multiprogramming system - each programmer works independently
                and each programmer can program different chip, if necessary.

            Benefits of the BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C multiprogramming
            solution:
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In generally, the BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C multiprogramming
              system take advantage of all benefits of
              BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C programmer.
            </li>
            <li>
              BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C programmer is a high performance
              universal programmer supporting many devices and growing. New
              software update is released monthly. Most gang programmers have
              limited number of supported devices, because they haven't
              universal hardware. It also takes very long time for device update
              and the cost could be high. The abilities to add new devices for
              BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C multiprogramming system is as
              unlimited because of BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C's universal
              hardware and the software updates are free of charge.
            </li>
            <li>
              BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C programmer is extremely fast. It is
              faster than most gang programmers. Therefore the multiprogramming
              solution based on the BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C programmer can
              program more chips in a day than a traditional gang
              multiprogrammer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Asynchronous (Concurrent) programming is more efficient than the
              synchronous (gang) programming of traditional gang programmers. In
              the concurrent multiprogramming mode each site operate
              independently. The programming starts as soon as a device is
              inserted into ZIF socket. Before the last device is loaded, the
              first device is already programmed and ready for removal. Operator
              is busy removing and inserting chips, so both the operator and
              programmer are running continuously at maximum efficiency. In
              standard gang programmer operation, the operator is idle while
              chips are being programmed, and the programmer is idle while chips
              are being removed and new chips inserted. Therefore for the medium
              programming times you can easily do the job of an 8-gang
              programmer with 2-4 of BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C programmers.
            </li>
            <li>
              We provide a wide range of programming adapters, therefore there
              is none problem to program also chips in the special packages. The
              very big sockets can be supported, such as PLCC84, TQFP176, etc.
              Most gang programmers are designed with narrow spacing between
              sockets.
            </li>
            <li>
              The special software (PG4UWMC = PG4UW Multiprogramming control) is
              available for controlling of the BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C
              programmers in the BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C multiprogramming
              mode. There is used a project file to control the
              BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C multiprogramming. Project file
              contains user data, chip programming setup information, chip
              configuration data, auto programming command sequence, etc.
              Therefore the operator error is minimized, because the project
              file is normally created and proofed by engineering and then given
              to the operator. The optional protected mode can be set for
              project file to avoid a unwanted changes of the project file.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hands-free operation. Asynchronous (concurrent) operation allows a
              chip to begin programming immediately upon insertion of a chip.
              The operator merely removes the finished chip and inserts a new
              chip. Operator training is therefore minimized.
            </li>
            <li>
              Service is easy. If one unit breaks down, the rest of the system
              is still running while having the defective unit serviced. You
              cannot do this with standard gang multiprogrammers.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Recommendations for BeeProg3/BeeProg2/BeeProg2C multiprogramming
            system:
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              use enough powerful PC for flawless operation. Please check
              recommended PC configuration.
            </li>
            <li>
              works with all versions of MS Windows from Windows XP to Windows
              11, 32-bit and 64-bit.
            </li>
            <li>
              use external 1/4 USB HUB rather than connecting programmers
              directly to the USB ports of the PC
            </li>
            <li>
              we've tested many USB hubs and we got best result with the Cypress
              chips based USB hubs.
            </li>
            <li>don't use USB 1.1 interface/hub/components</li>
