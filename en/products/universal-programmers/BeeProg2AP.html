              BeeProg2AP is an industrial version of BeeProg2 programmer for
              usage in automated programmers and ATE machines. The differences
              are:
            </li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the dimensions of the BeeHive204AP programmer are reduced -
                  compared to the BeeHive204 - in intent to minimize overhead of
                  the handler's arm movement
                </li>
                <li>
                  more mechanically stable case to be immune against vibration
                  during operation. The case of BeeHive204AP is prepared to be
                  fastened from top or from bottom of programmer body into
                  automated programmer working place
                </li>
                <li>
                  different construction of programming modules, stable enough
                  for insert/replace chips by mechanical arm and also that allow
                  to keep identical position of ZIF socket also after replacing
                  of the module
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li></li>
            <li>
              BeeHive204AP can be implemented into automated programmer (also as
              a replacement of obsolete programming unit(s) inside) and into ATE
              machines by two ways:
            </li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  up to 8 BeeProg2AP can be attached to one computer using USB
                  hub or USB ports of the PC
                </li>
                <li>
                  see please BeeProg2 description for other details of this
                  implementation
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li></li>
            <li>
              Implementation of BeeProg2AP into available 3rd party automated
              programmers and handlers (off-board IC testing ATE machines) is
              using simple remote control of the PG4UWMC control software.
              Implementation of BeeHive204AP into ATE machines for on-board IC
              programming and for on-board manual programming (using
              bed-of-nails) is using remote control of PG4UW software. There
              exist examples of implementation for standard programming
              languages and of course we are ready to help customer with this
              task.
            </li>
            <li></li>
            <li>
              For other (standard) parameters of BeeProg2AP programmer, see
              please description of BeeProg2.
            </li>
            <li></li>
            <li>
              BeeProg2AP programming modules have schematics identical like
              modules for BeeProg2 programmer, but these modules are
              mechanically designed for perfect stability at the top of the
              programmer and also in intent to keep identical position if the
              programming module is exchanged.

            <li>
              The list of BeeProg2AP programming modules is identical like
              BeeProg2 programming adapters , except the programming adapters
              that use ClamShell version of the ZIF socket (mainly adapters for
              BGA packages). We're continuously working on the finding of proper
              open-top ZIF sockets for such programming adapters.
