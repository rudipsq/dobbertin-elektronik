        <h3>
          General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this
          website
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal
          data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if
          special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1)
          DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal
          data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49
          (1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the
          access to information in your end device (e.g., via device
          fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on &sect;
          25 (1) TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is

          6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is required for the
          fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art.
          6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on
          the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
          Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is
          provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
        <p>
          In the scope of our business activities, we cooperate with various
          external parties. In some cases, this also requires the transfer of
          personal data to these external parties. We only disclose personal
          data to external parties if this is required as part of the
          fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g.,
          disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate
          interest in the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR, or if
          another legal basis permits the disclosure of this data. When using
          processors, we only disclose personal data of our customers on the
          basis of a valid contract on data processing. In the case of joint
          processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
        <p>
          A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject
          to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent
          you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the
          lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your
          revocation.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to
          object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
        </h3>
        <p>
          IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR
          (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING
          OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE
          SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE
          PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF
          DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU
          LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL
          DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION
          WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR
          INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS
          THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION
          PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
          IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT
          ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
          AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY

          AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
          DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING
          PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).
        </p>
        <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to
          log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member
          state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
          the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a
          complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court
          proceedings available as legal recourses.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the
          basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to
          you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you
          should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller,
          this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
        <p>
          Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the
          right to demand information about your archived personal data, their
          source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your
          data at any time. You may also have a right to have your data
          rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject
          matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not
          hesitate to contact us at any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as
          the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may
          contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing
          applies in the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
            archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim.
            During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the
            right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal
            data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an
            unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of
            the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of
            this data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
            exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
            demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data
            instead of its eradication.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your
            rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As
            long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have
            the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal
            data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these
          data &ndash; with the exception of their archiving &ndash; may be
          processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend
          legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons
          or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by
          the European Union or a member state of the EU.
        </p>
        <h3>Rejection of unsolicited e-mails</h3>
        <p>
