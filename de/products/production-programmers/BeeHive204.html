          <h2>Features</h2>
          <h3>General</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              BeeHive204 programmer is practically identical with the BeeHive4+
              programmer, difference is "only" much higher programming speed
              (20-70%) of high-capacity memories.
            </li>
            <li>
              BeeHive204 is extremely fast universal 4x 48-pindrive concurrent
              multiprogramming system designed for high volume production
              programming with minimal operator effort. The chips are programmed
              at near theoretical maximum programming speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              BeeHive204 consists of four independent isolated universal
              programming sites, based on the BeeProg2 programmer hardware.
              Therefore the programming sites can run asynchronously (concurrent
              multiprogramming programming mode). Each programming site starts
              programming at the moment the chip is detected to be inserted in
              the socket properly - independently on the status of other
              programming sites. It result, three programming sites works, while
              you replace the programmed chip at the fourth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Modular construction of hardware - the programming sites works
              independently - allows for continuing operation when a part of the
              circuit becomes inoperable. It also makes service quick and easy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hands-free operation: asynchronous and concurrent operation allows
              a chip to begin programming immediately upon insertion of a chip.
              The operator merely removes the finished chip and inserts a new
              chip. Operator training is therefore minimized.
            </li>
            <li>
              Supports all kinds of types and silicon technologies of today and
              tomorrow programmable devices without family-specific module. You
              can be sure the next devices support require the software update
              and (if necessary) simple package convertor (programming adapter),
              therefore the ownership cost are minimized.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using built-in in-circuit serial programming (ISP) connector, the
              programmer is able to program ISP capable chips in circuit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provides very competitive price coupled with excellent hardware
              design for reliable programming. Probably best "value for money"
              programmer in this class.
            </li>
            <li>
              Very fast programming due to high-speed FPGA driven hardware and
              execution of time-critical routines inside of the programmer. As a
              result, when used in manually-operated production, this
              one-socket-programmer in most cases waits for an operator.
            </li>
            <li>
              BeeHive204 interfaces with any IBM PC compatible personal
              computers, running MS Windows OS, through USB (2.0 HighSpeed)
              port.
            </li>
            <li>
              Banana jack for ESD wrist straps connection to easy-to-implement
              the ESD protection control.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Hardware (valid for each programming site)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              FPGA based totally reconfigurable 48 powerful TTL pindrivers
              provide H/L/pull_up/pull_down and read capability for each pin of
              socket. Advanced pindrivers incorporate high-quality high-speed
              circuitry to deliver signals without overshoot or ground bounce
              for all supported devices. Pin drivers operate down to 1.8V so
              you'll be ready to program the full range of today's advanced
              low-voltage devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each programming site performs device insertion test (wrong or
              backward position) and contact check (poor contact pin-to-socket)
              before it programs each device. These capabilities, supported by
              overcurrent protection and signature-byte check help prevent chip
              damage due to operator error.
            </li>
            <li>
              The selftest capability allow to run diagnostic part of software
              to thoroughly check the health of the each programming site.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built-in protection circuits eliminate damage of the programming
              site and/or programmed device due to environment or operator
              failure. All ZIF socket pins inputs and all pins of ISP conncetor
              of BeeHive204 programmer are protected against ESD up to 15kV.
            </li>
            <li>
              When programming specification require, the (BeeHive204)
              programmer performs programming verification at the marginal level
              of supply voltage, which, obviously, improves programming yield,
              and guarantees long data retention.
            </li>
            <li>
              Various Programming Adapters (Socket Converters) are available to
              handle device in PLCC, SOIC, PSOP, SSOP, TSOP, TSSOP, TQFP, QFN
              (MLF), SDIP, BGA and other packages.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Software (production mode control)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This part of the software is focused to the easy monitoring of
              high-volume production operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Operator-friendly control software combines many powerful
              functions with ease of use. Graphic user interface provide
              overview of all important activities result without burden of
              operator with non-important details.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is used a project file to control the BeeHive204
              multiprogramming system. Project file contains user data, chip
              programming setup information, chip configuration data, auto
              programming command sequence, etc. Therefore the operator error is
              minimized, because the project file is normally created and
              proofed by engineering and then given to the operator. The
              optional protected mode can be set for project file to avoid a
              unwanted changes of the project file.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each chip may be programmed with different data such as serial
              number, configuration and calibration information.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>
            Software (programming modules driver, engineering mode control)
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This part of the software is focused to the quick and easy
              preparation of the project file for usage in the production mode
              control software.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each programming sitee is driven by an easy-to-use control program
              with pull-down menu, hot keys and on-line help. Selecting of
              device is performed by its class, by manufacturer or simply by
              typing a fragment of vendor name and/or part number. It is the
              same years-proven software, as is used for all other Elnec
              single-site programmers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Standard device-related commands (read, blank check, program,
              verify, erase) are boosted by some test functions (insertion test,
              connection check, signature-byte check), and some special
              functions (autoincrement, production mode - start immediately
              after insertion of chip into socket).
            </li>
            <li>
              All known data formats are supported. Automatic file format
              detection and conversion during loading of file. There is possible
              to use Jam files (JEDEC standard JESD-71) and VME files
            </li>
            <li>
              The rich-featured auto-increment function enables one to assign
              individual serial numbers to each programmed device - or simply
              increments a serial number, or the function enables one to read
              serial numbers or any programmed device identification signatures
              from a file.
            </li>
            <li>
              The software also provide a many information about programmed
              device. As a special, the drawings of all available packages are
              provided. The software provide also explanation of chip labelling
              (the meaning of prefixes and suffixes at the chips) for each
              supported chip.

          <ul>
            <li>
              2708 memories (*1) are programmed by using 2708 additional module
            </li>
            <li>
              devices marked *2 are obsolete and some of them might require also
              PLD-1 additional module for programming
            </li>
            <li>
              the complicated devices with laborious implementation might
              belongs to the "Paid ISP support" category

          <h3>Package support</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>support devices in DIP into socket of the programmer</li>
            <li>
              package support includes DIP, SDIP, PLCC, JLCC, SOIC, SOP, PSOP,
              SSOP, TSOP, TSOPII, TSSOP, QFP, PQFP, TQFP, VQFP, QFN (MLF), SON,
              BGA, EBGA, FBGA, VFBGA, UBGA, FTBGA, LAP, CSP, SCSP etc. devices
              in non-DIP packages up to 48 pins are supported by universal
              programming adapters - if it is technically possible on the
              BeeHive204 programmer. That means if reliability of operations
              when used universal programming adapter is below industrial
              standard, the specialized programming adapters are necessary to
              use.
            </li>
            <li>
              programmer is compatible with many third-party adapters for
              non-DIP support

          </ul>

          <h3>Programming speed</h3>
          <p>Notes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It is important to know, we always use random numbers data pattern
              for programming speed testing. Some our competitors use "sparse"
              data pattern, where only few non-blank data are programmed or are
              there are used data with only few 0 bits (FE, EF, etc.). This
              cheating approach can "decrease" programming time considerable. If
              you plan to compare, always ask which pattern they use.
            </li>
            <li>
              The programming speed depends on PC speed only slightly, of course
              at condition the CPU usage is below 100%.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Notes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              *1 - implementation is the same as in card readers. Verification
              of programming is performed by internal controller, where internal
              controller confirm the proper programming using status register.
            </li>
            <li>*2 - the programming time is for TurboMode active.</li>
