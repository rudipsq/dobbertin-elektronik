              BeeHive204AP is an industrial version of BeeHive204 programmer for
              usage in automated programmers. The differences are:
            </li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the dimensions of the BeeHive204AP programmer are reduced -
                  compared to the BeeHive204 - in intent to minimize overhead of
                  the handler's arm movement
                </li>
                <li>
                  more mechanically stable case to be immune against vibration
                  during operation. The case of BeeHive204AP is prepared to be
                  fastened from top or from bottom of programmer body into
                  automated programmer working place
                </li>
                <li>
                  different construction of programming modules, stable enough
                  for insert/replace chips by mechanical arm and also that allow
                  to keep identical position of ZIF socket also after replacing
                  of the module
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              BeeHive204AP can be implemented into automated programmer (also as
              a replacement of obsolete programming unit(s) inside) and into ATE
              machines by two ways
            </li>
            <li></li>
            <p>
              1) using of standard PC, for example BeeHive204AP can be connected
              to the control PC of automated programmer.
            </p>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  up to 2 BeeHive204AP can be attached to one computer using USB
                  hub or USB ports of the PC
                </li>
                <li>
                  see please BeeHive204 description for other details of this
                  implementation
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li></li>
            <p>2) using BeeHive204AP control unit (option)</p>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Up to 2 BeeHive204AP programmers are controlled by
                  BeeHive204AP control unit. The BeeHive204AP control unit is
                  Windows Embedded OS driven computer, optimized for industrial
                  environment.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />
          <p>
            The selected way of the BeeHive204AP implementation into automated
            programmer or handler depends mainly on the type of chips you plan
            to program. Let's assume, the mechanical arm movement time, from
            picking up chip from the input tray (tape, ...) to chip insertion
            into ZIF socket of programmer, including fine positioning by camera,
            is 5 seconds. The time between chip removing from ZIF socket of the
            programmer and placement of chip to output tray (tape, ...) is 3s.
            Together it is 8 seconds, multiplied 7 sites (until one site is
            served, 7 sites are working) it is 56 seconds. Because the high
            programming speed of BeeHive204AP, only really large memories have
            programming time that exceed this time - and then the usage of
            BeeHive204AP control unit is needed for totally balanced performance
            of both programming system and handler.
          </p>
          <br />

          <ul>
            <li>
              If more than two BeeHive204AP programmers is necessary to
              implement into automated programmer, then more control PC is
              necessary to use. Whole system is scalable up to 64 programming
              sites in one automated programming system by multiplying of
              BeeHive204AP programmers and the control PCs. Maximal
              configuration comprise of 16x BeeHive204AP programmers. One
              control computer in the system serve as a master unit. Here is
              running also multiprogramming control software, serialization
              engine and interface to the host system. Interfacing of control
              PCs in whole network is done over standard LAN.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementation of BeeHive204AP into available 3rd party automated
              programmers and handlers (off-board IC testing ATE machines) is
              using simple remote control of the PG4UWMC control software.
              Implementation of BeeHive204AP into ATE machines for on-board IC
              programming and for on-board manual programming (using
              bed-of-nails) is using remote control of PG4UW software. There
              exist examples of implementation for standard programming
              languages for both ways of remote control and of course we are
              ready to help customers with this task.
            </li>
            <li>
              For other (standard) parameters of BeeHive204AP programmer, see
              please description of BeeHive204.
            </li>
            <li>
              For manual programming, we recommend to use BeeHive204 programmer,
              mainly due to wider range of programming adapters.
            </li>
            <li></li>
            <li>
              BeeHive204AP programming modules have schematics identical like
              programming adapters for BeeHive204 programmer, but these modules
              are mechanically designed for perfect stability at the top of the
              programmer and also in intent to keep identical position if the
              programming module is exchanged.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The list of BeeHive204AP programming modules is identical like
            BeeHive204 programming adapters, except the programming adapters
            that use ClamShell version of the ZIF socket (mainly adapters for
            BGA packages). We're continuously working on the finding of proper
            open-top ZIF sockets for such programming adapters.
