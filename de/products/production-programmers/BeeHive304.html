          <h2>Features</h2>
          <h3>General</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              BeeHive304 is next member of Elnec concurrent universal
              multiprogrammer series, built to meet the strong demand for an
              extremely fast and reliable multiprogrammer for high-capacity
              memories.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed with great emphasis on technical perfection and speed of
              hardware, this programmer perfectly fits for high-demanding
              desktop programming as well as for automated programming systems
              and ATE machines, where ensures the highest quality and overall
              yield.
            </li>
            <li>
              BeeHive304 consists of four independent isolated universal
              programming sites, based on the BeeProg3 programming core
              hardware. Therefore the programming sites can run asynchronously
              (concurrent multiprogramming programming mode). Each programming
              site starts programming at the moment the chip is detected to be
              inserted in the socket properly - independently on the status of
              other programming sites. As a result, three programming sites
              works, while you are replacing the programmed chip at the fourth
              site.
            </li>
            <li>
              The BeeHive304 multiprogrammer supports as many chips, as the
              BeeProg3 programmer and without obvious decrease of programming
              speed because each programming site works independently. Also each
              programming site can program a different chip, if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              Because the BeeProg3 programming core is based on a state of the
              art FPGA, powerful ARM processor and internal SSD, BeeHive304 is
              ready to program devices at theoretically possible speeds. The
              achieved ultra fast programming speed - more than 31 MB/s
              sustainable - is actually higher, than can be utilized for most of
              real devices. This is reflected in extremely short programming
              times. For example, the 8 GB eMMC NAND Flash could be done in less
              than 250 sec - if programmed memory allow that speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tests show, that the BeeHive304 is currently faster than all
              competitors in this price category (status: 10/2015), and for many
              chips is the fastest at all.
            </li>
            <li>
              BeeHive304 supports all kinds of types and silicon technologies of
              today's and tomorrow's programmable devices. It partially supports
              also devices 'from yesterday'. You can be sure the next devices
              support will require the software update only, at the most (if
              necessary) simple programming module, therefore the costs of
              ownership is minimized.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the proper and reliable programming of ultra-fast memories the
              BeeHive304 utilizes specialized modules, optimally designed for
              specific device families, exactly according to the needs of
              programmed devices. But if it is possible, then universal
              programming modules, dedicated for IC package type, are used. The
              programming modules are identical for all programmers based on the
              BeeProg3 programming core.
            </li>
            <li>
              Programming modules construction is designed for perfect stability
              at the top of the programmer, to be tough enough for
              insert/replace chips by mechanical arm and also allows to keep
              identical position of ZIF socket also after replacing of the
              module.
            </li>
            <li>
              Modular construction of hardware - the programming sites works
              independently - allows for continuous operation when a part of the
              programming sites becomes inoperable. It also makes service quick
              and easy.
            </li>
            <li>
              The sensing circuits detect proper placement of device in the
              socket of programming module, which allows to begin programming
              immediately upon insertion of a chip. The operator merely removes
              the finished chip and inserts a new chip. Operator training is
              therefore minimized.
            </li>
            <li>
              BeeHive304 interfaces with any IBM PC compatible personal
              computers, running MS Windows OS, through USB (2.0 HigSpeed) port
              or LAN port (up to 1 Gb).

              Banana jack for ESD wrist straps connection to easy-to-implement
              the ESD protection control.
            </li>
            <li>
              With its very competitive price together with excellent hardware
              design for reliable programming, it is probably the best 'value
              for money' programmer in this class.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Hardware (valid for each programming site)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The 64-pin rich-features, precise and powerful pindriver of
              BeeProg3 deliver high speed, accurate and clean waveform signals
              to the device by eliminating noise, ground bounce and overshoot,
              which maximizes programming yield and guarantees long data
              retention. This also allows the reliable support of virtually any
              nonvolatile technology used for programmable devices - (E)EPROM,
              Flash, MRAM, PCM, ... - by a single device programmer.
            </li>
            <li>
              FPGA based totally reconfigurable TTL pindrivers provide
              H/L/pull_up/pull_down and read capability for each pin of the
              device. The dual H/L drivers enables to provide two different H
              levels for both core signals and I/O signals of programmed device
              without additional logic. Programmer pindrivers operate down to
              0.8V, therefore the programmer is ready to program the full range
              of today's and tomorrow's advanced very-low-voltage devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Extremely fast programming, achieved by using FPGA based state
              machine, fast processor and SSD, allow execution of all
              time-critical routines and data transfers inside of the
              programmer.
            </li>
            <li>
              The programmer performs device insertion test based on the check
              of proper signal path between the programmer and programmed device
              before it programs each device. In dependence on programming
              configuration it identifies missed or poor contact between
              programmed device and the ZIF socket of the programming module,
              missed or poor contact between the programming module and the
              programmer and it's also able to indicate wrong position of device
              in the ZIF socket or the programming module (moved, rotated,
              backward oriented). These capabilities, supported by overcurrent
              protection and signature-byte check help prevent chip damage due
              to operator error.
            </li>
            <li>
              The selftest capability allows to run the diagnostic part of
              software to thoroughly check the health of the programmer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built-in protection circuits eliminate damage of programmer and/or
              programmed device due to environment or operator failure. All the
              inputs of the BeeProg3 programmer, including the pindriver
              signals, connection to PC and power supply input, are protected
              against ESD up to 15kV.
            </li>
            <li>
              The programming modules are available for devices in PDIP, PLCC,
              JLCC, SOIC, SDIP, SOP, PSOP, SSOP, TSOP, TSOPII, TSSOP, QFP, PQFP,
              TQFP, VQFP, QFN (MLF), SON, BGA, EBGA, FBGA, VFBGA, UBGA, FTBGA,

          <h3>Software (production mode control sw: PG4UWMC)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This part of the software is focused to the easy monitoring of
              high-volume production operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Operator-friendly control software combines many powerful
              functions with ease of use. Graphic user interface provide
              overview of all important activities result without burden of
              operator with non-important details.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is used a project file to control the BeeHive304
              multiprogramming system. Project file contains user data, chip
              programming setup information, chip configuration data, auto
              programming command sequence, etc. Therefore the operator error is
              minimized, because the project file is normally created and
              proofed by engineering and then given to the operator. The
              optional protected mode can be set for project file to avoid a
              unwanted changes of the project file.
            </li>
            <li></li>
            <li>
              Each chip may be programmed with different data such as serial
              number, configuration and calibration information using
              rich-features serialization system.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Software (programming site driver, engineering mode control sw:
            PG4UW)
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This part of the software is focused to the quick and easy
              preparation of the project file for usage in the production mode
              control software.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each programming site is driven by a comfortable and easy-to-use
              control program with pull-down menu, hot keys and on-line help. It
              is the same years-proven software, as is used for all other Elnec
              single-site programmers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Selecting of device is performed by its class, by manufacturer or
              simply by typing a fragment of vendor name and/or part number.
              Standard device-related commands (read, blank check, program,
              verify, erase) are boosted by some test functions (insertion test,
              signature-byte check), and some special functions (autoincrement,
              production mode - start of programming immediately after insertion
              of chip into socket).
            </li>
            <li>
              All known data formats are supported. Automatic file format
              detection and conversion during loading of file.
            </li>
            <li>
              The software also provides - in the Device information section -
              lots of information about the programmed device. As a special, the
              drawings of all available packages are provided. The software also
              provides explanation of chip marking (the meaning of prefixes and
              suffixes at the chips) for each supported chip.
            </li>
            <li>
              The rich-featured serialization function enables one to assign
              individual serial numbers to each programmed device - or simply
              increments a serial number, or the function enables one to read
              serial numbers or any programmed device identification signatures
              from a file and program it to programmed device.

          <h3>implementation into automated programming systems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              BeeHive304 programmer is ready for usage in the automated
              programming systems as well as for off-board IC testing ATE
              machines. The dimensions of programmer are reduced to technical
              minimum for this features&quality hardware in intent to minimize
              overhead of the handler's arm movement. The construction is
              mechanically stable to be immune against vibration during
              operation. The case of BeeHive304 is prepared to be fastened from
              top or from bottom of programmer body into automated programmer
              working place.
            </li>
            <li>
              The BeeHive304 can be implemented into automated programmer (as a
              replacement of obsolete programmer for example) or into some
              handler using more ways:
            </li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  1) if one or two BeeHive304 programmers are enough to do all
                  job, then is enough to use one control PC for whole
                  programming system, for both machine control and also
                  programmer software. The BeeHive304 can be attached to this
                  computer using USB or LAN port.
                </li>
                <li>
                  2) if more than two BeeHive304 programmers is necessary to
                  implement into automated programmer, then more computers are
                  necessary to use. Whole system is scalable up to 64
                  programming sites in one automated programming system by
                  multiplying of BeeHive304 programmers and the control PCs.
                  Maximal configuration comprise of 16x BeeHive304 programmers.
                  One control computer in the system serve as a master unit.
                  Here is running also multiprogramming control software,
                  serialization engine and interface to the host system.
                  Interfacing of control PCs in whole network is done over
                  standard LAN.

            <li>
              Implementation of BeeHive304 into software of automated
              programmers and handlers is by using of simple remote control of
              the PG4UWMC control software. There exist examples of
              implementation for standard programming languages and of course we
              are ready to help customer with this task.

            <li>
              *1: the data in the buffer are stored in fragments and also
              partially compressed, therefore the buffer can keep standard data
              also for bigger size devices, than current size of the buffer
            </li>

              *3: the programmers up to s/n 3004-00041 (including) was supplied
              with 32GB SSD as internal buffer.
            </li>
            <li>
              *4: the 128GB SSD can store as a buffer roughly 110GB of the
              random data (28GB in case 32GB SSD), the bigger sizes SSD,
              proportionally. If you plan to work/copy eMMC/NAND device, which
              might contain random data in full range of the device size, we
              recommend to have equal capacity buffer in the programmer.

          <h3>Programming speed</h3>
          <p>Notes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It is important to say, we always use random numbers data pattern
              for programming speed testing. Some our competitors use "sparse"
              data pattern, where only small amount of non-blank data are
              programmed or there are used data with only few 0 bits (FE, EF,
              etc.). This cheating approach can "decrease" programming time
              considerably. If you plan to compare, ask always which pattern
              they use.
            </li>
            <li>
              The programming speed practically doesn't depend on PC type
              because data for programming and main part of programming algo are
              stored internally inside of the programmer.
            </li>
            <li>
              All devices mentioned below, including both NAND Flash, are
              programmed at their maximal speed, the programming time can not be
              shorter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Currently exist not very much devices, where the 30+ MB/s
              BeeHive304 programming speed can be utilized.
